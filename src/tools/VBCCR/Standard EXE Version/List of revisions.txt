16-May-2023
- Usage of MIM_MENUDATA for TbrButtonMenus in the ToolBar control.

13-Oct-2021

- Enhancement for the FrameW control.
  - Access key now supported.
  - TabIndex now supported. (important to be set meaningful so the access key works properly)

- Added optional 'Index' param in the .WorkAreas.Add method (to insert before index) in the ListView control.

12-Jul-2020
- Reworked the .WorkAreas property in the ListView control.
  It is not anymore a property which just returns/sets an array of coordinates.
  Instead it returns now a collection to the new 'LvwWorkAreas' class.
  The collection is not 'private' and relies fully on LVM_GETWORKAREAS/LVM_SETWORKAREAS.
  The .ListItemIndices of a 'LvwWorkArea' returns all list items that belongs to a work area.
  Also the new .WorkArea property of a 'LvwListItem' returns the work area to which a list item belongs to.

  Thus it does not clash anymore with the 'Index As Integer' param in a control array.

  Because a virtual list view does only inform about each selected item and not for each deselected item.

  This results for 'ComCtlsTopParentValidateControls' being obselete and was removed!

19-Apr-2017
- Internal improvement in the Slider control.
- Included the MouseEnter/MouseLeave event and MouseTrack property in the Slider control.

18-Apr-2017
- All internal tooltips are now as top-most, thus ensuring that tooltips will always be shown.
  This is done by either SetWindowPos HWND_TOPMOST (created by comctl32) or directly WS_EX_TOPMOST on CreateWindowEx (own tooltip).
- The internal tooltip in the TreeView control respects now changes in the VisualStyles property.

17-Apr-2017

23-Mar-2017
- Included the PrintQuality/ColorMode/Duplex property in the CommonDialog class.
- Fixed GDI leak for 'hDC' in the CommonDialog class. (DeleteObject on Class_Terminate or new return of printer dialog)

20-Mar-2017
- Critical bugfix in the PrinterDriver/PrinterPort after user selections in the CommonDialog class.
  This might caused wrong initialization in case 'PrinterDefaultInit' is set to False.
- PrinterDriver/PrinterName/PrinterPort will be set empty when default printer (wDefault = DN_DEFAULTPRN) was selected in the CommonDialog class.
  This ensures that the default printer remains active also when it got changed in the meantime.

19-Mar-2017
- VB.Printer object is no longer used in the CommonDialog class.
  Therefore included the PrinterDriver/PrinterName/PrinterPort property which will be set
  automatically when the user selected a printer in a print dialog box.
  So even when 'PrinterDefault' is False, you can write code to print directly to the VB.Printer object in your app.
  Also included the PrinterDefaultInit property which indicates if the default (like the original MS CommonDialog)
  or user-selected printer will be initialized in a print or page setup dialog box.

18-Mar-2017
- Included the PaperSize/PaperBin property in the CommonDialog class.
  The printer dialog will now read/write to that PaperSize/PaperBin property instead of the VB.Printer object.
- When Orientation, PaperSize and/or PaperBin properties are not set explicitly in the CommonDialog class then
  the default driver settings will be used until the first printer dialog has been succesfully finished.
  If the properties are not set explicitly they will however return some "most common default values", but that
  does not necessarily mean that these are the default driver settings that will be used later on in the dialog boxes.
  This approach is the same as in the original MS CommonDialog, though the PaperSize/PaperBin are not exposed/accesible.

17-Mar-2017
- Bugfix when using flag 'CdlPDReturnDefault' in the ShowPrinterEx dialog (no bug in ShowPrinter) in the CommonDialog class.
- Included the Orientation property in the CommonDialog class. (like the original MS CommonDialog)
  The printer dialog will now read/write to that Orientation property instead of the VB.Printer object.

16-Mar-2017
- The default value of 'PrinterDefault' is now True instead of False in the CommonDialog class.
- Included the Copies property in the CommonDialog class. (like the original MS CommonDialog)
  The printer dialog will now read/write to that Copies property instead of the VB.Printer object.

21-Feb-2017
- Included the AllowOverType and OverTypeMode property in the TextBoxW control.
  The default value of AllowOverType is False. (contrary to the RichTextBox control, where default value is True)

19-Feb-2017
- Included the AllowOverType and OverTypeMode property in the RichTextBox control.

14-Feb-2017
- Improved the SelPrint and PrintDoc methods in the RichTextBox control.
  It can now also be used on a non-printer DC, e.g. DC of a PictureBox.

13-Feb-2017
- Two bugfixes in the SelPrint and PrintDoc methods in the RichtTextBox control.
  - RightMargin/BottomMargin were added to the printable area instead deducted.
  - The printable area was not converted from device units to twips. (the paper area was not wrong)

09-Feb-2017
- Improved the themed border appearance in the RichTextBox control.
  It can be now in a 'hot' and 'focused' state, beside the already exist 'disabled' and 'normal' state.

06-Feb-2017
- Bugfix in the Text property of a ComboItem in the ImageCombo control.

03-Feb-2017
- Bugfix in the RightToLeft property in the TabStrip control. (TCIF_RTLREADING now used instead of WS_EX_RTLREADING)

21-Jan-2017
- Fixed a bug that the item's checkboxes/options were not drawn grayed in a disabled non-standard Style ListBoxW control.
  On update from 18-Oct-2016 was only the text fixed to drawn grayed in that case, but not the button itself.

20-Jan-2017
- Enhanced the Style property with '2 - Option' in the ListBoxW control.
  Also included the OptionIndex run-time property.
- Included the AutoSelectFirstItem property in the ListView control. (Default is True)
  Setting to False equals MS 5.0 ListView behavior and True equals MS 6.0 ListView behavior.

19-Jan-2017
- Two minor bugfixes in the ListBoxW control.
  - Direct clicking the checkbox (Checkbox Style and MultiColumn set to True) was not possible when not selected before. (behavior bug)
  - If both RightToLeft and MultiColumn are set True the top index goes negative and everything is unpredictable and unstable. (MS bug?)
    Solution was to set (in that specific case) the right-to-left alignment after the control was created.

15-Jan-2017
- Included the ItemBeforeCheck event (with 'Cancel' parameter) in the ListBoxW control.
- Bugfix that the checked state was not unchecked by default of a new inserted item in a Checkbox Style ListBoxW control.
- Included X/Y parameter in the OLEGetDropEffect event in the RichTextBox control.

14-Jan-2017
- The Locked property in the ComboBoxW control works now like the original VB ComboBox.
  So, beside the locking of the edit control, the list portion is locked as well.
  The drop-down list can be shown but no item can be selected by mouse or key from the user.
  That also means that now the Locked property is available when having the style set to 'DropDownList'.
- Same ComboBoxW improvements implemented into the ImageCombo control.

13-Jan-2017
- 16-bit barrier for thumb scrolling circumvented in the ComboBoxW control. (like as for the ListBoxW control)
- Included the ScrollTrack property in the ComboBoxW control.
- .hWndList in the ComboBoxW control is now working on Windows 2000.
  Message CB_GETCOMBOBOXINFO is not supported on Windows 2000. (similar issue as 29-Feb-2016 update)
  Thus the message got replaced by the API GetComboBoxInfo in user32.dll.

10-Jan-2017
- Bugfix for the 32-bit thumb scrolling support in the ListBoxW control.
  It now also works in a multi-column list box or when doing a 'HorizontalExtent' scrolling.

09-Jan-2017
- 16-bit barrier for thumb scrolling circumvented in the ListBoxW control. (standard windows list box limitation)
- Included the ScrollTrack property in the ListBoxW control.

08-Jan-2017
- Some minor internal improvements.

07-Jan-2017
- Included the InsertMark/InsertMarkColor property and HitTestInsertMark function in the ListBoxW control.
  The InsertMark property and the HitTestInsertMark function have both an optional 'After' parameter.
- Bugfix that NewIndex property was not initialized with -1 in the ListBoxW control. (no bug in ComboBoxW control)

04-Jan-2017
- Fixed a bug that when setting the Text property by code it did not respect the MaxLength property in the TextBoxW, ComboBoxW and ImageCombo control.
- Some other minor internal improvements.
