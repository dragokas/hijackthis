; Rules for translators:
; ----------------------
; 1. First 5 space characters "     " are ignored
; 2. First ";" character is a mark of comment
; 3. [], [*], [**] should not be modified or deleted !!!
; 4. You should not add empty lines for just convenience unless it is a part of translation string.
; 5. "&" signs can be removed, but instead preferred to place them next to the nonrepeatable characters among nearby rows
; (these signs are responsible for hotkeys: ALT + letter, which is located next to the sign "&" will cause opening of the corresponding menu)
; 6. "\\p" signs are intended to devide a long text into several pieces, so each of them fit into the window as a whole.

0001=Welcome to HiJackThis Fork.
     This program will generate a report of unusual items
     (files, registry modifications etc.) in the most vulnerable areas of the operating system,
     commonly manipulated by malware as well as good software.
0002=HiJackThis is already running.
     Are you sure you want to launch another copy?
0004=Below are the results of the HiJackThis scan. Be careful what you delete with 'Fix checked' button.
     Scan results do not determine whether an item is good or bad. If you think  your machine is infected,
     press the 'AnalyzeThis' button, sign up, read instructions, make required logs,
     and show them to our consultants by creating a new thread.
0007=It looks like you're running HiJackThis from a read-only device like a CD-ROM. If you want to make backups of items you fix, you must copy HiJackThis.exe to your hard disk first, and run it from there.
     
     If you continue, you might encounter 'Path/File Access' errors.
0008=Launching from an archive is forbidden!

0054=This can be useful when you are adding HiJackThis to startup
0055=Do not show main menu at startup
0057=Are you sure you want to enable this option?
     HiJackThis is not a 'click & fix' program. Because it targets *general* hijacking methods, false positives are a frequent occurrence.
     If you enable this option, you might disable programs or drivers you need. However, it is highly unlikely you will break your system beyond repair. So you should only enable this option if you know what you're doing!

     Note: it is recommended that you add all safe items to the ignore list (e.g. with context menu -> Add ALL to ignore list), so the results window will appear after system startup only when new items are found.
     Also, it can be useful to mark the checkbox "Mark everything found for fixing after scan".

; [O1]
0409=        1) Windows uses records in the 'hosts' file to look-up domain names before querying internet DNS servers. Changes to the 'hosts' file can make Windows believe that e.g. 'google.com' has a different IP than it actually has, leading browsers to open a different page. It can also block site(s) entirely by redirecting them to localhost or a non-existent IP. 

             2) Attackers can also hijack the DNSApi.dll file to alter the location where the system loads the hosts file (all OS versions). Example: Hijacker.DNS.Hosts / Trojan.Win32.Patched.qw.

             3) Attackers can also change registry DatabasePath values (Win XP and older).
\\p
             4) Hosts.ics file is created automatically when you share internet access. It contains a mapping between IP and home (local) network domain and can be hijacked in the same way as a hosts file.
     
     Infected examples:
     213.67.109.7	google.com
     127.0.0.1	kaspersky.ru
     DNSApi: File is patched - c:\Windows\system32\dnsapi.dll

     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - For hosts and hosts.ics entries - Line is deleted from file.
      - For DNSApi - dll file is recovered if available using SFC subsystem.
      - For altered hosts location - default registry value is restored.
      - Also, DNS cache entries are flushed and DNS caching services are restarted.
; [O2]
0410=        A BHO (Browser Helper Object) is a specially crafted program that integrates into IE, and has virtually unlimited access rights. Though BHO's can be helpful (like the Google Toolbar), hijackers often use them for malicious purposes such as tracking your online behavior, displaying popup ads, etc.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Delete BHO registry key and all corresponding keys (like CLSID and special IE BHO policies);
      - Delete BHO dll file.
; [O3]
0411=        IE Toolbars are part of BHO's (Browser Helper Objects) like the Google Toolbar that may be helpful, but can also be annoying or malicious by tracking your behavior and displaying popup ads.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Delete registry value and all corresponding keys (like settings and special IE BHO policies).
      - dll file is deleted.
; [O4]
0412=        This part of the scan checks for several suspicious entries that autoload when Windows starts. Autoloading registry entries may load a script (VBS, JS, HTA file, etc) possibly causing the Start Page, Search Page, Search Bar or Search Assistant to redirect to a hijacker's page. A DLL file can also be loaded that hooks into different parts of your system. Scripts, other programs, or fileless registry entries (e.g. legit system file PowerShell.exe with arguments) in autostart can also be used as droppers that load other malicious files via the internet, or ensure the survival of malware after a reboot.
             O4 section also includes listing of autorun disabled items (MSConfig / TaskMgr).
\\p     
     Area to be checked: registry keys and 'Autostart' folder.

     Infected example: regedit c:\windows\system\sp.tmp /s
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Autostarting registry entries - registry value is deleted.
      - also, corresponding process will be killed or freezed.
      - 'AutoStart' folder - autoloading file is deleted.
      - Disabled autorun items - registry entry is deleted (For Windows 8+: autoloading file is deleted too. For Windows 7 and older: autoloading file left in the folder: C:\Windows\pss).
; [O5]
0413=        Modifying CONTROL.INI can cause Windows to hide certain icons in the Control Panel. Though originally meant to speed up Control Panel loading and reduce clutter, it can also be used by hijackers, for example, to prevent access to the 'Internet Options' window.
     
     Area to be checked: control.ini file and equivalent locations in the registry.

     Infected examples:
     control.ini: [don't load] inetcpl.cpl = yes (Internet Control Panel)
     HKCU\Control Panel\don't load: [Firewall.cpl] (Windows Firewall Control Panel)
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - depending on location, line is deleted from Control.ini file or registry value is deleted.
; [O6]
0414=        Disabling the 'Internet Options' menu entry in the 'Tools' menu of IE is done using Windows Policies. Normally used by administrators to restrict user access, it can also be used by hijackers to prevent access to the 'Internet Options' window.
     
             StartPage Guard also uses Policies to restrict homepage changes, done by hijackers.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - corresponding information is deleted from the registry.
; [O7]
0415=
     O7 - Policies: Regedit, TaskMgr, Explorer and "Start" menu

             Disabling of Regedit is done using Windows Policies. Normally used by administrators to restrict users, it can also be used by hijackers to prevent access to the Registry editor. This results in a message saying that your administrator does not allow you to access Regedit.
             Malicious programs also disable access to the Task Manager to protect themselves from termination.
             Some items may be blocked in Explorer and Start menu, making navigation difficult. For instance, the disc is hidden in "My Computer" folder.
\\p
     O7 - IPSec

             IP Security Policies allow or block network data packets, and fine-tune source and destination packet filters like IP address (including subnet), type, port number and more.

     O7 - Untrusted Certificate

             Malicious programs can add antivirus digital signature hashes to the list of untrusted certificates, thereby blocking the launch of executable files.

     O7 - TroubleShoot

             Here, incorrect OS settings are displayed, which potentially lead to system and software malfunctions. These include:
     1. [EV] Incorrect value and/or type of environment variable. Check for important paths in the %PATH% variable.
     2. [Disk] Lack of free space on the system disk (less than 1 GB.)
     3. [Network] Wrong network settings, e.g. empty computer name.
\\p
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - for O7 - Policies: registry value is deleted.
      - for O7 - IPSec: all registry keys associated with the marked policy are deleted, including all the filters that apply to it.
      - for O7 - Untrusted Certificate: registry key is deleted.
      - for O7 - TroubleShoot: [EV] variables will be reset to defaults. For %PATH% - the missing path will be added.
      - for O7 - TroubleShoot: [Disk] Microsoft disk cleanup manager CleanMgr will be launched in automatic mode.
      - for O7 - TroubleShoot: [Network] standard settings will be applied.
; [O8]
0416=        Extra items in the context (right-click) menu can prove helpful or annoying. Some recent hijackers add items to the context menu. The Internet Explorer PowerTweaks Web Accessory adds several useful items, including "Highlight", "Zoom In/Out", "Links list", "Images list" and "Web Search".
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry key is deleted.
; [O9]
0417=        Extra items in the Internet Explorer 'Tools' menu and extra buttons in the main toolbar are usually present as branding (Dell Home button) or added after system updates (MSN Messenger button) and rarely by hijackers. The Internet Explorer PowerTweaks Web Accessory adds two menu items, "Add site to Trusted Zone" and "Add site to Restricted Zone".
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry key is deleted.
; [O10]
0418=        The Windows Socket system (Winsock) uses a list of providers for resolving DNS names (i.e. translating www.microsoft.com into an IP address). This is called the Layered Service Provider (LSP). Some programs are capable of injecting their own (spyware) providers in the LSP. If files referenced by the LSP are missing or the 'chain' of providers is broken, none of the programs on your system can access the Internet. Removing references to missing files and repairing the chain will generally restore Internet access.
\\p
             Note: LSP fixing is a risky procedure. You can get WinSockReset from https://www.foolishit.com/vb6-projects/winsockreset/ to repair the Winsock stack.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Not provided. You will be asked to go to www.foolishit.com and download the WinSockReset program.
; [O11]
0419=        Options in the 'Advanced' tab of Internet Explorer options are stored in the Registry, and extra options can be added by creating extra Registry keys. Very rarely, spyware/hijackers add their own options which are hard to remove. (e.g. CommonName adds a section 'CommonName' with a few options.)
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry key is deleted.
; [O12]
0420=        Plugins handle filetypes that aren't supported natively by Internet Explorer. Common plugins handle Macromedia Flash, Acrobat PDF documents, and Windows Media formats, enabling the browser to open these itself instead of launching a separate program. When hijackers or spyware add plugins for their filetypes, malware - even if it's been removed - may be reinstalled if the browser opens a file handled by that plugin.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry key and plugin file are deleted.
; [O13]
0421=        When you type a URL into Internet Explorer's Address bar without the prefix (http://), a prefix is automatically added when you hit Enter. This prefix is stored in the Registry, together with the default prefixes for FTP, Gopher and other protocols. When a hijacker changes these to the URL of their server, you are always redirected there when you do not enter a prefix. For example, Prolivation uses this hijack.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry value is restored to default data.
; [O14]
0422=        When you hit 'Reset Web Settings' on the 'Programs' tab of the Internet Explorer Options dialog, your homepage, search page and a few other sites are reset to default values. These defaults are stored in C:\Windows\Inf\Iereset.inf. When a hijacker changes these to his own URLs, 'Reset Web Settings' causes you to be (re)infected. For example, SearchALot uses this hijack.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Value in the Inf file is restored to default data.
; [O15]
0423=        Websites in the Trusted Zone (see Tools => Internet Options => Security => Trusted sites => Sites) are allowed to use potentially dangerous scripts and ActiveX objects. Some programs automatically add sites to the Trusted Zone without you knowing. Only a very few legitimate programs are known to do this. 
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry key is deleted.
      - Protocol to Zone mapping defaults is restored.
; [O16]
0424=        The Download Program Files (DPF) folder in your Windows base folder holds various programs that were downloaded from the Internet. These programs are loaded whenever Internet Explorer is active. Legitimate examples include the Java VM, Microsoft XML Parser and Google Toolbar. When deleted, these objects are downloaded and installed again (after prompting).
             Unfortunately, IE also lets malicious sites automatically download things like porn dialers, bogus plugins, and ActiveX Objects to this folder, which haunt you with popups, large phone bills, random crashes, and other browser hijackings.
     
      >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - registration of DPF CLSID is cancelled.
      - dll file and downloaded file are deleted.
; [O17]
0425=        Windows uses several registry values to help resolve domain names into IP addresses. Hijacking these values can cause all programs that use the Internet to redirect to other pages.
             Lop.com uses this method, together with a (huge) list of cryptic domains.

             DHCP DNS in this section displays the DNS address issued by the router by DHCP, i.e. when the "Automatically receive DNS address" checkbox is selected in network connection settings.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry value is deleted.
      - When fixing DHCP DNS, DNS Resolver Cache is flushed. The user must manually configure the router by entering the address specified by their contract provider BEFORE fixing this item in HiJackThis. 
; [O18]
0426=        A protocol is a 'language' Windows uses to 'talk' to programs, servers or itself. Webservers use the 'http:' protocol, FTP servers use the 'ftp:' protocol, Windows Explorer uses the 'file:' protocol. Introducing a new protocol to Windows or changing an existing one can change how Windows handles files.
             CommonName and Lop.com both register new protocols when installed (cn: and ayb:).
\\p
             Filters are content types accepted by Internet Explorer (and internally by Windows). If a filter exists for a content type, data will pass through the content-type file handler first. Several variants of the CWS trojan add a text/html and text/plain filters, allowing them to hook all webpage content passed through Internet Explorer.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - CLSID value is restored (if possible), otherwise the key is deleted.
      - File is deleted (if it's not belong to Microsoft).
; [O19]
0427=        IE has an option to use a user-defined stylesheet for all pages instead of the default one, to enable handicapped users to better view webpages.
             An especially vile hijacking method made by Datanotary has surfaced, which overwrites any stylesheet the user has configured and replaces it with one that causes popups, as well a system slowdown when typing or loading pages with many pictures.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry value is deleted.
      - Style using is disabled.
; [O20]
0428=        Files specified in the AppInit_DLLs Registry value are loaded very early during Windows startup and stay in memory until system shutdown. This way of loading a .dll is rarely used, except by trojans. Examples of legitimate records here can be libraries of video drivers or cryptographic systems. AppInit_DLLs will not load if Secure Boot is enabled.
             The WinLogon Notify Registry subkeys load dll files into memory at a similar point in the boot process, keeping them loaded into memory until the session ends. Apart from several Windows system components, adware like VX2, ABetterInternet and Look2Me use this Registry key.
\\p
             Since both methods ensure the dll file stays loaded in memory, fixing this won't help if the dll restores Registry values or keys after you fix them. In such cases, it is recommended to use the 'Delete file on reboot' function or KillBox to first delete the file.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - for AppInit_DLLs: Concrete registry value is cleared; parameter is NOT deleted.
      - for Winlogon Notify: Registry key is deleted.
; [O21]
0429=        This is an undocumented Registry key that contains a list of CLSID references, which in turn reference .dll files that are loaded by Explorer.exe at system startup. The dll files stay in memory until Explorer.exe quits, which is achieved either by shutting down the system or killing the shell process.
\\p
             ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers works similarly. This registry key contains several subkeys with identifiers of the files loaded to Explorer.exe. Usually, one program registers several such handlers at once. Key names often start with a few spaces. These libraries are responsible for handling file icon rendering in Windows Explorer, depending on certain conditions (file types or other factors).
             An example of a legitimate program can be a client for cloud storage like DropBox or Yandex.Disk, which changes the appearance of the icon depending on the state of file synchronization. Malicious programs may install handlers that also execute arbitrary code.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry value or key is deleted together with CLSID identifier key.
      - dll file is deleted.
      - Explorer is restarted.
; [O22]
0430=        Task Scheduler is a service that can be configured to run an arbitrary process at a specified time or on a certain schedule. One such setting is called a Job. Jobs (tasks) can be run with elevated privileges without requesting UAC, be bound to specific users, contain paths to processes, arguments, states, and so on. Malware often uses tasks to provide autorun and still survive after a process is restarted.
             Tasks can be managed through the Task Scheduler snap-in (taskschd.msc).

     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - The task is disabled.
      - The task's process is killed.
      - The task file, executable file and all associated registry keys are deleted.
; [O23]
0431=O23 - Service

             'Services' are a special type of program required for proper system functionality. Service processes are started before the user logs in and are protected by Windows. They can only be stopped from the services dialog in the Administrative Tools window.
             Malware that registers itself as a service is therefore harder to kill.
\\p
     O23 - Driver
             (the subsection is only available in the "Additional scan" mode)

             The driver is a kind of service that is launched at an earlier stage of the system boot and runs with kernel privileges. Malicious programs can also install their drivers. For instance, this is used to prevent the deletion (programs running with Administrator or Local System rights can not kill kernel-level processes), as well as to mask their presence, files and processes (so-called rootkits).
             Note: the "Driver R" items without a digit character in log - is a dynamically loaded driver (not through the registry).
\\p
     O23 - Dependency
             (the subsection is only available in the "Additional scan" mode)

             Malicious programs can write themselves into the list of dependencies of the system service to protect themselves from deletion. After removing such a service, a legitimate Microsoft service will no longer be able to start. Some Windows services are critical for the normal operation of OS. Their non-launching can negatively affect the operation of other programs up to the whole OS boot fails.
             Some services are also combined into a service group, which has its name. If the service depends on the service group, it will not start until all services that belong to service group is start. HiJackThis also checks for third-party services that have been included in the Microsoft service group.
\\p
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Service (or driver) is disabled, stopped and removed.
      - Reboot will be prompted.
      - For O23 - Dependency: the dependency will be deleted from the registry.
; [O24]
0432=        Desktop Components are ActiveX objects that can be made part of the desktop whenever Active Desktop is enabled. They run as (small) website widgets.
             Malware abuses this feature by setting the desktop background to a local HTML file with a large, bogus warning, e.g. for Ransomware it may show text of ransom requirements.
     
     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - Registry key and file are deleted.
      - Explorer is restarted and desktop background is updated.
; [O25]
0433=        Windows Management Instrumentation is a default Windows service. It can create permanent event consumers for both legitimate and malicious purposes. These events can collect hardware and software data to automate malware activities like spying. They can create pipes to connect between machines, or execute external script files or script code stored inside (fileless). Events can be triggered by the WMI subsystem at set intervals (like Task Scheduler) or manually when applications execute special WMI queries.
\\p
             Note: only the consumer is tested. If there are only a filter, binding and/or a timer (without consumer), the item is not displayed in the log.

     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - event consumer, filter, timer and binding are deleted in WMI database;
      - associated file is also deleted.
; [R4]
0434=        Internet Explorer uses search provider (DefaultScope) to show a list of tips in the search bar while you type search queries into the address bar. IE allows you to replace its default provider with any from the list (SearchScopes).

     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - provider key is deleted;
      - default value of DefaultScope (Microsoft Bing) and provider parameters are recovered.
; [O26]
0435=        In the 'Image File Execution' Registry key, a program can be set up to use a debugger. Whenever the host program is started, the 'debugger' program is loaded instead.
             Note: when a debugger file deleted but still set, the host program will not start!

     >>> Action taken by HiJackThis:
      - registry value is deleted.

     [Windows 9x/ME]
0612=Map several *.ini files to the Registry. Some of the settings can be used to start programs at system startup.
     [Windows NT/2k/XP/2003/Vista]
0613=On CDs, an autorun.inf file tells Windows what file to auto-start. This technique can also be applied to hard disks, making Windows execute arbitrary files when the drive is opened in Explorer.
     [Windows 95/98/NT4/2000/XP/2003]
0614=Windows can execute scripts when the system starts or shuts down, or when a user logs on or off.
     [Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/8/8.1/10]
0615=Windows uses *.bat files for starting certain system components. Anything in these files is executed at system startup.
     [winstart.bat,dosstart.bat: Windows 95/98/98SE]
     [autoexec.bat,config.sys: Windows 9x/ME]
     [autoexec.nt,config.nt: Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0616=Windows can perform actions (such as deleting or renaming a file) when the system is restarted. These instructions can be stored in the Registry or the wininit.ini file. The wininit.bak file is a backup of wininit.ini, and it is created by Windows itself.
     [wininit.ini: Windows 9x/ME]
     [other: Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0617=These settings control what Windows does when certain filetypes are opened - if a file is run by itself, or if an application is used to open it. This setting can be hijacked to load different or additional programs.
     [All Windows versions]
0618=Windows services play an important role in Windows NT4, 2000 and XP (and newer), and a smaller one in Windows 95, 98 and ME. All listed items are started at system startup.
     [NT Services: Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/8/8.1/10]
     [VxD Services: Windows XP and older]
0619=Device drivers can insert themselves into the chain of drivers for a hardware device, either above it (UpperFilters) or below it (LowerFilters), enabling them to filter messages before passing them on to other drivers. The class filters apply to generic types of hardware. The device filters apply to specific devices only.
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/8/8.1/10]
0620=When a user logs on, winlogon.exe performs a number of actions. Certain DLL libraries and programs are started and will stay loaded until the user logs off. The Notify subkey contains links to dll libraries that are loaded when a particular event occurs, like logging on/off, starting up, shutting down, or activating a screensaver.
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/8/8.1/10]
0621=Browser Helper Objects are loaded with Internet Explorer (and sometimes Windows Explorer) and can view, control and modify everything inside Internet Explorer.
     [Internet Explorer 4.0 and newer]
0622=ActiveX objects. When loaded for the first time, these objects run before the user logs on.
     [All Windows versions]
0623=Toolbars loaded and displayed (if enabled) when Internet Explorer is loaded.
     [Internet Explorer 4.0 and newer]
0624=Additional buttons and tools that are loaded and displayed (if enabled) when Internet Explorer is loaded.
     [Internet Explorer 4.0 and newer]
0625=Additional special bars that are loaded and displayed (if enabled) when Internet Explorer is loaded.

     [Internet Explorer 4.0 and newer]
0628=The objects in the 'Downloaded Program Files' are additional plug-ins to Internet Explorer and are loaded when it starts. When deleted, these objects are downloaded and installed again (after prompting).
     [Internet Explorer 4.0 and newer]
0629=Hooks that can intercept and redirect URLs entered into the Internet Explorer address bar.
     [Internet Explorer 4.0 and newer]
0630=Due to the way Windows looks up paths for files, putting a file Explorer.exe in folders other than the Windows folder can cause them to be executed instead of the normal Explorer.exe file. Explorer.exe should only exist in the Windows directory.
     [All Windows versions]
0631=In the 'Image File Execution' Registry key, a program can be setup to be used with a debugger. Whenever the host program is started, the 'debugger' program is loaded instead.
     Note: when a debugger file deleted but still set, the host program will not start!
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/8/8.1/10]
0632=When an item is added to the right-click menu of certain items, the associated dll library is loaded into memory when the system starts.
     [All Windows versions]
0633=Programmers can add custom columns to Explorer and 'Detailed' view item. The dll library associated with the column is loaded into memory whenever the 'Detailed' view or additional columns are active.

     [Run,RunOnce,RunOnceEx: All Windows versions]
     [RunServices,RunServicesOnce, Windows 9x/ME]
0637=The Registry contains 'Run' keys with subkeys that contain values that are executed on system startup (mostly only once, after which the keys are deleted by Windows).
     [All Windows versions]
0638=Windows Policies can be used to start applications when the system is started or a user logs in. Also, they can be used to set up the work environment (Shell) for a user, including any restrictions.
     [All Windows versions]
0639=Pluggable MIME filters and protocol handlers can see and manipulate everything that passes through them through Internet Explorer and the URL Moniker.
     [All Windows versions]
0640=The Accessibility Utility Manager determines if programs like Magnifier and Screen Reader are loaded when Windows starts. It can also start other programs on system startup.
     [Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0641=WOW is the 16-bit compatibility manager of Windows. Its Registry key contains several values that can be used to start programs or dll libraries under certain conditions. The KnownDlls lists contain all dll libraries that can be run from the System folder only. If a dll with the same name is present elsewhere, it will not be loaded.
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0642=Shell Service Objects are loaded by Explorer as soon as it starts.
     [All Windows versions]
0643=Sshared Task Scheduler items (in the Registry) are loaded every time you open Explorer.
     [All Windows versions]
0644=Similar to the 'Notify' Registry key in Windows 2000/XP, this Registry key can be used by Windows 95/98/ME to load a dll.
     [Windows 9x/ME]
0645=When the Windows 2000/XP command line is opened (CMD.EXE), it will look for this Registry value and execute any program in it before starting.
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0646=Layered Service Providers (LSP) are small programs that can be added or inserted into the Windows TCP/IP handler by other software. Data outward bound from your computer to a legitimate destination on the Internet can be intercepted by an LSP and sent to a new destination. They are executed before the user logs in.
     [All Windows versions]
0647=Autostarts from non-Microsoft programs.
0648=ICQ contains a component named ICQNET that can run other applications when an Internet connection is detected.
0649=mIRC can load custom scripts that have malicious purposes. These scripts can perform virtually any action on a system.
0650=All autostart items that are disabled, or serve only to block websites, domains, ActiveX objects, etc.
0651=The most common places on a Windows system that a browser hijacker will hook into, apart from the autostart locations.
0652=The URLs that Internet Explorer is reset to are stored in a file called IERESET.INF, and these URLs are used whenever you use 'Reset Web Settings'.
     [Internet Explorer 5 and newer]
0653=All URLs that have been set up for Internet Explorer to use as start pages, search pages, search bars, etc. Note: some of these are only used under certain conditions.
     [All Internet Explorer versions]
0654=When an address is typed into the Address Bar without 'http://' or 'www' prefixes, Internet Explorer will look here for the default text to prefix.
     [Internet Explorer 5 and newer]
0655=The location of the hosts file can be changed from the default in Windows 2000/XP (c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc). If a hosts file is present at any other location, it is ignored.
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/Vista/2003]
0656=The hosts file can be used like a local DNS server, mapping host names to IP addresses. While this speeds up name resolving, it can also be used to block domains by mapping them to a non-routable IP addresses like 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0.
     [All Windows versions]
0657=Internet Explorer checks this Registry key before loading and executing an ActiveX control. If the CLSID of the control is marked as incompatible (using a 'kill bit'), it will not be loaded. Only blocked ActiveX objects that actually exist on the system are listed here.
     [Internet Explorer 4 and newer]
0658=Internet Explorer uses several zones to determine security policies for websites, some with more permissions (Trusted Zone) or with less permissions (Restricted Zone). This can allow or prevent a site from executing ActiveX, Java, scripting, or other objects.
     [Internet Explorer 4 and newer]
0659=All autostart items that are disabled using the MSConfig tool in Windows 98/ME.
     [Windows 98/ME]
0660=All autostart items that are disabled using the MSConfig tool in Windows XP.
     [Windows XP/2000/Vista]
0661=NT Services that are not currently running, either because they are stopped, set to run manually, or disabled.
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0662=Windows has a central control point, called Security Center, where antivirus, firewall and update settings are managed. However, all three monitors can be overridden or disabled.
     [Windows XP Service Pack 2]
0663=Windows XP has a feature called System Restore which enables the user to save snapshots of system configurations, and roll back to one of those snapshots later. While restore points can consume a lot of disk space, rollbacks are very effective.
     [Windows ME/XP]
0664=Windows Firewall can allow programs to send or receive data based on filenames or port numbers (though not both in one rule). While it has rudimentary options to set remote IP ranges for a 'rule', all rules are stored in the Registry unencrypted, allowing any program to add itself to the Exceptions list.
     [Windows XP SP2/2003/Vista/7/8/8.1/10]
0665=This Registry key contains all drivers that monitor print ports.
     [All Windows versions]
0666=This Registry value contains a list of DLL files loaded by Windows at startup.
     [All Windows versions]
0667=Desktop Components are ActiveX objects that can be made part of the desktop whenever Active Desktop is enabled, where it runs as a (small) website widget.
     [Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0668=The 'App Paths' Registry key maps an executable to its full path, so for example you can type 'wordpad' in the Run dialog to start the actual Wordpad app. It is also possible to modify the setting to start completely different programs.
     [All Windows versions]
0669=Much like the autorun.inf file, Windows has a Registry key that can set a program to automatically start when a disk or CD is inserted. This MountPoints key can also be configured to start a program when a user opens or explores a hard drive.
     [All Windows versions]
0670=When the system is started in Safe Mode, Windows will load these services ONLY, instead of all of the ones listed above. When using Safe Mode with Network Support, some network services are also loaded.
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0671=When the system is started in Safe Mode with Command Prompt, this value sets the filename for the command prompt which replaces the standard shell (Explorer.exe). For reasons unknown, this alternate shell is also used (if enabled) when starting the system in normal mode (!).
     [Windows NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0672=Microsoft Windows Defender can be disabled with a single Registry value. When this is to 1, the system is not protected.
     [Windows XP/2003/Vista]
0673=Packages listed here are part of the Windows NT Local Security Authority (LSA) and are called on certain system events.
     Authentication packages are called when a user attempts to log on to Windows.
     Notification packages are called when passwords are set or changed.
     Security packages are implementations of security protocols such as Kerberos, SSL and TLS.
     [Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0674=These drivers and libraries are loaded whenever the application involved requires it.
     [Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista]
0675=Windows Policies can be used to restrict individual user accounts. This primarily involves restricting access to system tools and functions.
